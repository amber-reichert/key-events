"1850/07/10","","Day",<p>Judge William Cranch administers the executive oath to Millard Fillmore, making Fillmore the nation's thirteenth President. Knowing that Fillmore's sympathies lie with the proposed congressional compromise, regarding the number of free and slave states, Zachary Taylor's cabinet resigns unanimously.

"1850/08/06","","Day",<p>Fillmore announces his support of the compromise. He sends a message to Congress recommending that (1) Texas be paid to abandon claims to part of New Mexico and (2) that the Wilmot Proviso, which states that all land acquired from the Mexican War be closed to slavery, be overturned. </p>
"1850/09/09","","Day",<p>As one of the recommendations of the compromise, California enters the Union as the thirty-first state. As a "free" state, its admittance gives non-slaveholding states a majority in the Senate. Simultaneously, the Texas and New Mexico Act establishes boundaries between the two.

Similarly, the Utah Act decides boundaries of Utah according to the principles governing New Mexico. </p>
"1850/09/18","","Day",<p>Congress passes the Fugitive Slave Bill, prohibiting individuals from aiding runaway slaves, and threatening fines and imprisonment to those who do.

"1850/09/20","","Day",<p>Congress passes the Compromise of 1850, written by Kentucky senator Henry Clay.

The deal settles the issue of slavery in the newly acquired territories, dividing the country along the thirty-seventh parallel, with slavery in the South and free states in the North.

"1850/09/28","","Day",<p>President Fillmore names Brigham Young, president of the Mormon Church, governor of the Utah territory.  From 1846 to 1847, Young leads thousands of disciples from Illinois to the central Utah valley, where he establishes Salt Lake City, the site for the Church's new temple. With hundreds of new arrivals each year, Young founds scores of colonies to provide the inhabitants with homes and land; at his death in 1877, nearly 400 Mormon colonies exist.
