Washington</i> seizes the <i>Amistad</i>, a mutinous slave ship, and brings the captives to a jail in New Haven, Connecticut. West African slaves had taken over the Cuban ship, traveling from one Cuban port to another, and sail up the United States coastline.

These principles dictate the return of the <i>Amistad</i> and its occupants to Havana. ","Martin Van Buren"
